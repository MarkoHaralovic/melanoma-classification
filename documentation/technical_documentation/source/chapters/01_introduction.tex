\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}

This technical documentation provides an overview of our melanoma classification pipeline, developed as part of the Lumen Data Science competition during the 2024/2025 academic year. It is intended to serve both as a user guide and a developer reference for understanding, executing, and reproducing our solution.

The report is structured to walk the reader through every aspect of the system—from environment setup and modular code architecture, to training, evaluation, and deployment workflows. We explain how to use the CLI interface, modify configurations, and run trainings. Special attention is given to environment reproducibility using Docker and Conda, and to the modular design of the training components (data loading, model configuration, loss functions, and evaluation metrics).

Finally, we include a detailed reproducibility checklist—giving the exact configuration, system setup, and commands required to reproduce our best-reported results.
